## üéØ Problem Statement

**Over 70 million Americans have criminal records**, creating barriers to employment, housing, and education. Every state has expungement or record sealing laws that offer relief, but the process is complex, confusing, and often inaccessible to those who need it most. Traditional legal services are expensive, and navigating state-specific court forms and eligibility criteria without guidance is overwhelming.

**The challenge:** How can we democratize access to criminal record relief and make the expungement process accessible, affordable, and understandable for everyone across all 50 states?

---

## üí° Our Solution

**Expungo** is an AI-powered platform that simplifies the expungement process across all 50 states through three key innovations:

1. **Intelligent Document Analysis**: Upload your RAP sheet (Record of Arrest and Prosecution) or court documents, and our Gemini-powered PDF parser automatically extracts case details, convictions, and dates.

2. **RAG-Based Eligibility Assessment**: Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with ChromaDB and LangChain, we analyze your specific case against state-specific statutes, court rules, and eligibility requirements across all 50 states to provide personalized guidance.

3. **Voice-Enabled AI Assistant**: Talk through your case with our LiveKit-powered conversational agent that understands legal terminology, asks clarifying questions, and provides step-by-step guidance in natural language.

**Result:** Transform a weeks-long, confusing legal process into a 15-minute guided experience.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (use legacy peer deps for compatibility)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at: **http://localhost:3000**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Gemini Configuration  
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here

# ChromaDB Configuration (optional, uses local by default)
CHROMA_HOST=localhost
CHROMA_PORT=8000
```

#### Initialize ChromaDB Vector Store

```bash
# Run the initialization script to populate ChromaDB with legal documents
python -m scripts.initialize_chromadb
