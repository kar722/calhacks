5. In granting this order under the provisions of Penal Code section 1203.49, the court finds that the petitioner was a victim of 
human trafficking when petitioner committed the crime.
a.The court orders (check one):
(1) the relief described in section 1203.4.
(2) the relief described in section 1203.4, with the following exceptions (specify):
b.The Department of Justice is hereby notified that petitioner was a victim of human trafficking when petitioner committed the 
crime, and notified of the relief ordered. 
6.If this order is granted under the provisions of Penal Code section 1203.4, 1203.41, or 1203.42, 
a.the petitioner is required to disclose the above conviction in response to any direct question contained in any questionnaire or     
application for public office, or for licensure by any state or local agency (or, under Penal Code section 1203.41, for licensure by 
a federally recognized tribe or for enrollment as a provider of in-home supportive services and "waiver personal care 
services" (see Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 12300–12318, 14132.95, 14132.952, 14132.956, 14132.97)), or for contracting with the 
California State Lottery Commission; and  
b.dismissal of the conviction does not automatically relieve petitioner from the requirement to register as a sex offender.  
(See, e.g., Pen. Code, § 290.5.)
7.If this order is granted under the provisions of Penal Code section 1203.4, 1203.4a, 1203.41, 1203.42, or 1203.49, the petitioner is 
released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense except as provided in Penal Code sections 29800 and 29900 
(formerly sections 12021 and 12021.1) and Vehicle Code section 13555. In any subsequent prosecution of the petitioner for any 
other offense, the prior conviction may be pleaded and proved and shall have the same effect as if probation had not been granted 
or the accusation or information dismissed. The dismissal does not permit a person to own, possess, or have in their control a 
firearm if prevented by Penal Code section 29800 or 29900 (formerly sections 12021 and 12021.1). Dismissal of a conviction does 
not permit a person prohibited from holding public office as a result of that conviction to hold public office.
8.Dismissal under Penal Code section 1203.4 or 1203.4a does not release petitioner from the terms and 
conditions of any unexpired criminal protective order issued under Penal Code section 136.2(i)(1), 273.5(j), 
368(l), or 646.9(k).
9.In addition, as required by Penal Code section 299(f), relief under Penal Code section 17(b), 17(d)(2), 
1203.4, 1203.4a, 1203.41, 1203.42, or 1203.49 does not release petitioner from the separate administrative 
duty to provide specimens, samples, or print impressions under the DNA and Forensic Identification 
Database and Data Bank Act (Pen. Code, § 295 et seq.) if petitioner was found guilty by a trier of fact, not 
guilty by reason of insanity, or pled no contest to a qualifying offense as defined in Penal Code section  
296(a).
10.The basis for an order of dismissal granted under the provisions of Penal Code section 1203.43 is the 
invalidity of petitioner's prior plea due to misinformation in former Penal Code section 1000.4 regarding the 
actual consequences of making a plea and successful completion of a deferred entry of judgment program.
11.Notice: Except as provided in Penal Code section 1203.425(a)(4), if this order is granted under Penal Code section 1203.4, 
1203.4a, 1203.41, or 1203.42, the court must not disclose information concerning a conviction granted relief to any person or entity, 
in any format, except to the person whose conviction was granted relief or to a criminal justice agency.FOR COURT USE ONLY
